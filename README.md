# GobStopper

Pauses all YouTube videos when the user clicks the icon or presses F4

This is useful when working in an office environment where you may be
frequently interrupted while listening to music on Youtube or other
video/music streaming sites, and it is not always convenient to be
riffing through your open tabs closing the sound-making tab in front
of co-workers, bosses, clients, etc.


## Supported Browsers

Tested on Firefox 68, but it should also just work on most others
modern ones (e.g. most versions of Chrome).


## Roadmap

Release targets are tentative only:

* 0.1.0 - Pause videos on Youtube only
* 0.2.0 - Pause videos/sound on other common sites
          (e.g. Vimeo, Soundcloud, Spotify, RNZ)
* 0.3.0 - Resume playback on tabs that were playing at the time
* 0.4.0 - Pause Brightcove based players?
